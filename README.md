# chrome-extension-for-youtube
A Chrome extension to replace Youtube video link with embedded Youtube video that runs on the same page instead of redirecting you to Youtube website.

Search does not work properly when user search for some video second time without reloading web page. Here I have handled this through DOMNodeInserted eventlister which apparently not an ideal solution.

//TODO - find a suitable event listener
